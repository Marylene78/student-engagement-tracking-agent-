Student Engagement Tracking Agent
The Student Engagement Tracking Agent is an AI-driven model designed to analyze and monitor student engagement based on their performance and interaction with academic activities. 
This project utilizes a dataset that includes information on quizzes, lessons, exams, and course ratings.
By examining these aspects, the model identifies patterns in student behavior, predicts engagement levels, and provides actionable insights to educators and administrators.
Key features of the model include engagement prediction, which estimates students' engagement levels using advanced machine learning techniques, and behavioral insights, which highlight the factors influencing engagement, such as low participation in quizzes or declining course ratings. The model is flexible and allows for the customization of metrics, enabling adaptation to various datasets and specific engagement criteria.

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine, load your dataset in the required format, and use the provided scripts to train the model. The results can be visualized or exported as reports for further analysis. This tool is designed to support educators in identifying and addressing engagement challenges to enhance the learning experience.
